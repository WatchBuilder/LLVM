# WatchBuilder LLVM

This repository contains the source code for the LLVM libraries used by
WatchBuilder. They are the same libraries used in the version of `clang`
included with Xcode 5.1 (specifically, `clang-503.0.38`). The sources
were obtained from [opensource.apple.com](http://www.opensource.apple.com/).
